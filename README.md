Iterative closest point via particle filtering
This code is basically used for 2D/3D point set registration, and the registration process is modelled as a state estimation problem, which can be solved efficiently via filtering techiniques, like UKF, CKF and particle filter. 
To understand the theory, the readers are referred to [1][2]. Also, it is good to refer these two articles if you use this code.
Special thanks goes to Jihua Zhu, who provided me with the code of particle filter.
